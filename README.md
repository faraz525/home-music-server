## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- **Raspberry Pi** (4 or 5 recommended) with **64-bit OS**
- **SSD storage** (recommended for music library)
- **Docker & Docker Compose** installed
- **Git** for cloning the repository

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/home-music-server.git
   cd home-music-server
   ```

2. **Prepare your storage**
   ```bash
   # Create music directory on your SSD
   sudo mkdir -p /mnt/music/cratedrop
   sudo chown -R $USER:$USER /mnt/music/cratedrop
   ```

3. **Configure environment (optional)**
   ```bash
   # Create and edit environment file
   cat > .env << 'EOF'
   # Application Environment
   APP_ENV=production

   # Base URL (change to your domain/IP)
   BASE_URL=http://localhost

   # Data Directory (where music files and database are stored)
   DATA_DIR=/mnt/music/cratedrop

   # JWT Security (CHANGE THESE IN PRODUCTION!)
   JWT_SECRET=your-super-secret-jwt-key-here
   REFRESH_SECRET=your-super-secret-refresh-key-here

   # Gin Framework Mode (debug/release)
   GIN_MODE=release
   EOF

   nano .env  # Edit JWT secrets and other settings
   ```

4. **Start the application**
   ```bash
   # Build and start all services
   docker compose up -d --build

   # Check that everything is running
   docker compose ps
   ```

5. **Access your music server**
   - Open your browser and go to `http://your-pi-ip`
   - Default admin credentials will be shown in the logs

### First Time Setup

1. **Create admin user**
   ```bash
   docker compose logs backend | grep "Admin user created"
   ```

2. **Login** with the displayed admin credentials

3. **Generate invite codes** from the Admin panel

4. **Share invites** with friends to let them create accounts

## 📖 Usage Guide

### For DJs/Music Users

1. **Sign up** using an invite code from an admin
2. **Login** to access your personal dashboard
3. **Upload tracks** by dragging files or clicking upload
4. **Search & browse** your music library
5. **Play tracks** directly in your browser with full seek support
6. **Manage your tracks** - delete old files to free up space

### For Admins

1. **Access Admin panel** (available only to admin users)
2. **View all users** and their activity
3. **Generate invite codes** for new users
4. **Monitor storage usage** and system health
5. **Manage the music library** - delete any track if needed

## 🔍 Logging & Monitoring

CrateDrop provides comprehensive logging to help you monitor your music server:

### View Logs

```bash
# View all logs
docker compose logs

# Real-time log monitoring
docker compose logs -f

# View specific service logs
docker compose logs backend
docker compose logs frontend

# Recent logs with timestamps
docker compose logs --tail=20 -t

# Logs from last hour
docker compose logs --since 1h
```

### Log Analysis

```bash
# Filter for errors
docker compose logs | grep -i error

# View API requests
docker compose logs backend | grep "GET\|POST"

# Monitor user activity
docker compose logs | grep "192.168.1.100"  # Replace with user IP

# Track file uploads
docker compose logs backend | grep "upload"
```

### Log Files

- **Container logs**: Available via `docker compose logs`
- **File logs**: Stored in `./logs/` directory (if configured)
- **Health checks**: Automatic every 30 seconds

### Log Format

```
[CrateDrop] 2025/09/02 15:04:05 | 200 | 45.23µs | 192.168.1.100 | GET /api/tracks
[GIN] 2025/09/02 - 15:04:05 | 200 | 45.23µs | 192.168.1.100 | GET /api/healthz
```

## 🔧 Configuration

### Environment Variables

| Variable | Default | Description |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| `APP_ENV` | `production` | Environment (development/production) |
| `BASE_URL` | `http://localhost` | Base URL for the application |
| `DATA_DIR` | `/mnt/music/cratedrop` | Directory for music storage |
| `JWT_SECRET` | `dev-jwt-secret` | Secret for JWT tokens |
| `REFRESH_SECRET` | `dev-refresh-secret` | Secret for refresh tokens |

### Storage Layout

```
/mnt/music/cratedrop/
├── library/          # User track storage
│   └── <user_id>/
│       └── <track_id>/
│           └── original.<ext>
├── db/              # SQLite database
├── backups/         # Database backups
└── logs/            # Application logs
```

### Optional: BPM & Musical Key Analysis

CrateDrop can auto-detect BPM and musical key (Camelot notation) for uploaded
tracks. This requires the `streaming_extractor_music` binary from essentia on
the server's `PATH`. The provided Dockerfile installs it via `apt` when the
image builds.

- **Docker (default):** the image ships with essentia pre-installed. No action
  needed unless the build logs show `WARNING: essentia-examples not installed`.
- **Bare metal:**
  - Debian / Raspberry Pi OS: `sudo apt install essentia-examples`
  - macOS (dev): `brew install essentia --HEAD`

If the binary is missing, the server still starts — it logs `WARNING:
streaming_extractor_music not on PATH — analysis disabled` and skips the
analysis worker. Uploads and playback continue to work normally; tracks stay
in `pending` status until the binary is available. Install it and restart
the server to drain the backlog.

Users can override a wrong detection by double-clicking the BPM or Key cell
in the library view.

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Port 80 already in use**
```bash
# Check what's using port 80
sudo netstat -tlnp | grep :80

# Stop conflicting service or change port in docker-compose.yml
# ports:
#   - "8080:80"  # Change from 80 to 8080
```

**Backend container keeps restarting**
```bash
# Check backend logs for errors
docker compose logs backend

# Common causes:
# - Database migration errors
# - Storage permission issues
# - Port conflicts
```

**Cannot upload large files**
```bash
# Check nginx client_max_body_size in nginx.conf
# Default is 2GB, increase if needed
client_max_body_size 4G;
```

**Storage permission errors**
```bash
# Ensure proper permissions on music directory
sudo chown -R 1000:1000 /mnt/music/cratedrop
```

### Health Checks

```bash
# Check application health
curl http://localhost/api/healthz

# Check container status
docker compose ps

# Restart services
docker compose restart
```

## 🏗️ Development

### Prerequisites

- **Go 1.23+** for backend development
- **Node.js 20+** for frontend development
- **Docker & Docker Compose** for containerized development

### Local Development

```bash
# Quick local deployment (recommended)
./deploy-local.sh

# Or manually with Docker Compose
docker compose up -d --build

# Backend development
cd backend
go mod download
go run main.go

# Frontend development
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev

# Full stack with Docker
docker compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml up
```

#### Local vs Production Deployment

- **Local Development**: Uses `./data/cratedrop` directory (automatically configured via `docker-compose.override.yml`)
- **Production/Raspberry Pi**: Uses `/mnt/music/cratedrop` directory (configured in main `docker-compose.yml`)

To deploy to production:
```bash
./deploy-prod.sh
```

### Building

```bash
# Build all services
docker compose build

# Build specific service
docker compose build backend
docker compose build frontend
```
